Turn GitHub issues into working code — automatically.

Built for devs who want to move fast, stay focused, and spend less time grinding through tickets. Our tool connects directly to your repo and transforms your GitHub issues into real pull requests using AI, so you can review and ship instead of rewrite and stress.

## 🚀 Vision

We're on a mission to **eliminate unresolved GitHub issues** and cut up to **90% of development effort** for repetitive tasks and feature requests.

Instead of spending hours fixing bugs or wiring up simple features, let the AI do the first pass. You stay in control — reviewing, refining, and shipping.

We’re not replacing devs. We’re making them 10x faster.


## 👥 Who's this for?

Right now, we're building for:
- Solo devs ⚡️
- Indie hackers 🛠️
- Startup teams 🚀

But the system is designed to grow with your project — from a weekend idea to full-scale production.


## 🧪 How it works (under the hood)

1. **Connect your GitHub repo** — we’ll spin up a temporary clone.
2. **Select an issue** — from the dashboard or by mentionning **@anthony.run** in a comment.
3. **The AI reads, thinks, and codes** — based on the issue, your codebase, and project context.
4. **You get a PR** — with detailed changes and explanation.

You review → merge or tweak → done.

We use an AI agent in a secure, sandboxed job runner. Your code never leaves the system unless you're shipping it.


## ✨ What's new here?

We’re not just throwing code suggestions in your editor like Copilot. We’re solving the entire issue, end to end.

- ✅ Natural language issues → real PRs  
- ✅ Secure, isolated environment per job  
- ✅ AI agent understands your repo structure  
- ✅ Focus on high-value tasks like review + QA  


## 🧠 Why we built this

We love building — not managing endless tickets.  
Our goal is to **help teams move faster** by automating the repetitive stuff so developers can **focus on things that matter**: architecture, testing, performance, and innovation.
